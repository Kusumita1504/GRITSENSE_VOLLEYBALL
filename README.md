# GRITSENSE

This project appears to be related to computer vision, possibly involving object detection or pose estimation, based on the presence of several `.pt` (PyTorch model) files and a `main.py` script.

## Project Structure

- `main.py` — Main Python script to run the project.
- `ball.pt`, `court.pt`, `player_detection.pt`, `pose.pt` — Pre-trained PyTorch model files, likely for different detection or recognition tasks.

## Getting Started

1. **Requirements**
   - Python 3.x
   - PyTorch
   - Other dependencies as required by `main.py` (see code for details)

2. **Running the Project**
   - Place all `.pt` model files in the project root directory.
   - Run the main script:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - (If your entry point is different, adjust the filename accordingly.)

3. **Notes**
   - Ensure all required dependencies are installed (see `main.py` for import statements).
   - The `.pt` files should not be modified unless you are retraining the models.

## GPU Performance Engineering

The isolated [`gpu-performance/`](gpu-performance/README.md) subproject contains CPU/GPU inference runners for the existing EPV checkpoint, validated TorchScript/optional ONNX exports, repeatable benchmark and profiling tools, and an independent CUDA vector-add example. It does not replace or modify the volleyball analytics pipeline.
